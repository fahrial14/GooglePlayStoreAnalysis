Google Play Store Dataset Analysis

The dataset for this project was scraped from the Google Play website and stored in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps). The dataset includes more than 10,000 apps and 13 features.

## Analysis Questions
* What category has the highest amount of apps?
* Do users really care about large apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
* Does the price of an app affect its rating?
* Is there a significant difference in sentiment polarity between a Google Play store app that is either paid or free?
